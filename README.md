# Song and Film Project

## What is Song and Film?

It is a project requested by a client on the freelance platform Fiverr, to make a website previously made in Wordpress, and that the client requested to pass it to HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

This repository contains the trial version of the site. It has been recreated from the original site design (in Wordpress).

Below you will find the link to see the project in progress: [Song & Film](https://alexadictiva.github.io/songandfilm/)

When the client confirme the desing, I will put here the link to the official site
