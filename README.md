# Song and Film Project

## What is Song and Film?

It is a project requested by a client on the freelance platform Fiverr, to make a website previously made in Wordpress, and that the client requested to pass it to HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

This repository contains the trial version of the site. It has been recreated from the original site design (in Wordpress).

In this project I was able to learn, apart from other things, CSS properties like clip-path: polygon, which is used to make the necessary sections have a polygon shape. And to have the exact measurements we can consult this page [clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/). This, thanks to the help of @yadurani, who with his simple answer on twitter, saved my project.

Below you will find the link to see the project in progress: [Song & Film](https://alexadictiva.github.io/songandfilm/)

When the client confirme the desing, I will put here the link to the official site
